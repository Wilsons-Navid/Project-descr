Project Name: Agri-mentor
Description: Farmer mentor application
AGRI-MENTOR


Summary

We have successfully implemented our solution for helping farmers decide which product to plant based on factors such as soil condition and market trends, such as values. So far, the program can recommend crops to the farmers just as required, thus, this suffices to say we are on track.

Achievements

The app operates well for now. It receives inputs from the user, such as acidity, moisture, and other factors affecting production. Furthermore, based on the algorithms, the values received from the farmer, and the conditions, it recommends the crop to the farmers. However, The product needs improvement as we will need to use real APIs and machine learning to recommend the crops to the farmers accurately

Challenges
The synergy and working spirit have been encouraging as a team from the beginning. The only issue we are facing is that most of our team members are in different time zones, and this makes scheduling sessions difficult. Aside from that, I believe the team is well.

To solve this and ensure 100% participation, we are going to discuss as a team around two days before the set meeting time, in such a way that it doesn't negatively affect any team member. For now, I won't say we need any major help, but we are pretty sure we will need it. In that case, we will schedule a session with the learning coach

Next Steps

- So far, I think we have been doing well as a team, and every other member has been doing a great job, and thus we hope to continue in this spirit and energy. Moreover, as regards the time differences, we will make sure the time we set for our meetings suits everyone and will meet them In their most productive state.
